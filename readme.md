<a href="https://d3js.org"><img src="https://d3js.org/logo.svg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="6"></a>

These are my efforts to create data driven, reusable visualizations on a webpage using JavaScript's D3 library.

Included are:

* Pie Chart
* geoJSON
* Time Series

## Pie Chart

A multi level, drill down pie chart.

Features:

* displays any nested dataset
* no limitation to number of levels
* drill down by clicking the pie slice or the legend entry
* drill up by clicking the BACK-Button
* hover and click transitions makes the chart feel responsive
* tooltip displays information on currently hovered data subset
* 9 different color ramps

Some features can be turned on or off at will by setting their values to true or false in the config.

Optional features:

* display a heading shows the name of the current level
* display a legend
* display labels inside the pie slices
* play a transition on the legend entry when hovering the corresponding pie slice in the chart
